        <h2>National Weather Service predicting rain and snow showers in eastern Idaho this weekend</h2>
        <h4>By Rett Nelson, EastIdahoNews.com</h4>
        <img src="images/snow.jpg" alt="idaho billoard">
        <p class="estilo8">As Chinese President Xi Jinping passed an apartment complex last week during his tour of Wuhan, ground zero of the global coronavirus pandemic, he looked up and waved back at rows of residents who — still under lockdown — greeted him behind masks from their apartment windows.

The upbeat footage — beamed into millions of homes across China later that evening — was meant to send a confident message that, under Xi’s leadership, the country had turned a corner.

But for many Wuhan residents, the images on state media do not match with the reality of day-to-day life.

“What’s for sure is that Xi Jinping cannot hear any genuine voices at all,” said resident Zhang Yi of the leader’s visit, his first since the outbreak emerged in Wuhan in December.

Zhang, and many others like him, have been sealed off from the outside world since late January, when the metropolis of 11 million was placed under a state-imposed lockdown to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus — and their frustrations have been mounting.


When the epidemic was at its most severe, many Wuhan patients said they were unable to get treated due to an extreme shortage of hospital beds and medical resources. Now, as the number of new reported cases in China slows to a trickle, millions of residents are still restricted by the government to their homes; they’re not even allowed to go outside to shop for groceries. Instead, the residents CNN spoke to said they have to rely on designated neighborhood committees to make group orders for daily necessities — often at a higher price.

While state media has doubled down on constructing a positive narrative of life in Wuhan, the deep well of public anger resulting from stringent censorship, soaring food prices and the failures of the local government is starting to chip away at the propaganda facade.

The coronavirus has now spread to more than 140 countries and territories worldwide, and a growing number of governments — like that of Italy, Spain and the Philippines — have imposed lockdowns like the one first introduced in Wuhan. The strict measures in the Chinese city have been credited with slowing the outbreak: for the past three days, Wuhan has reported new cases in the single-digits compared with nearly 4,000 per day a month ago. However, the lockdown has also come at a cost to millions of people.
